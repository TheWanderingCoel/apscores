# apscores
A faster, cleaner, more robust AP® score proxy, skipping the not-so-great web UI of the College Board®. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the College Board® in any way.

Basically, this program takes your credentials, pretends it is you, then gets your scores and forwards them to you. Think of it as calling a friend who lives in an area that can access scores earlier. Nothing is stored, and every effort is made to keep your data as secure as necessarily possible. The website has a more in-depth explaination.

The code is here for your viewing pleasure (or pain). Installation instructions and support are not provided.
